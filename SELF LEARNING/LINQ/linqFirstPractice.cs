// LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
//LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that provides a way to query and manipulate data from different sources such as collections, databases, XML or objects. It integrates query capabilities directly into the C# language using a set of query operators and extension methods.
//LINQ provides a declarative, SQL-like syntax for filtering, sorting, grouping and transforming data.

        var result = numbers.Where(n => n > 5).Select(n => n * 2);

        LINQ Query flow
        1. Data Source: It is the collection of elements on which the query will run. In code, int[] nums = { 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 } is the data source.
        2. Filtering: It is the process of selecting elements based on a condition. In code, Where(n => n > 5) filters numbers greater than 5.
        3. Projection: It transforms each element into a new form. In code, Select(n => n * 2) doubles each filtered number.
        4. Execution: The query actually runs when iterated. In code: The foreach loop executes the query and prints results.
        
        Note: LINQ supports both query syntax and method (lambda) syntax, making code readable, concise and consistent across data sources.
